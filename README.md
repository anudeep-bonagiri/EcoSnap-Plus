# ♻️ EcoSnap Plus

## 🌱 Inspiration  
As we brainstormed ideas for our environmental science hackathon, we wanted to create something that was both **educational and fun**. Inspired by our favorite childhood learning games, we came up with **EcoSnap Plus**—a click-based game that transforms environmental awareness into a fast-paced, engaging experience.

---

## 🕹️ What It Does  
**EcoSnap Plus** is an interactive, click-based game that:

- Challenges players to quickly **identify and collect recyclable items** while avoiding distractors.
- Tracks **score** and **time**, with multiple game modes for added variety.
- Integrates **Vision AI** to detect recyclable materials using your device’s camera.
- Features an **interactive cleanup map** that connects users to real-world environmental events.

Together, these features turn learning into action.

## 🧠 Vision AI Recycling Detection  

We added a revolutionary **Vision AI** feature:

- 📷 Simply point your device’s camera at an object  
- 🤖 Our AI model analyzes and classifies the material  
- ✅ Provides **instant feedback** on recyclability + disposal tips

### 🔍 Why It Matters  
Many people are unsure what’s recyclable. Our AI solves this by using a model trained on thousands of household items, helping users make informed, eco-friendly choices in real time.

---

## 🗺️ Interactive Cleanup Map  
Using **Leaflet.js** and a dark-themed **CartoDB** basemap, our map allows users to:

- Discover **local cleanup events** near them
- View event info (name, location, date/time, volunteer needs)
- **Join** events directly in-app with a click of a button
- Track which events they've joined

This bridges the gap between **digital learning** and **real-world environmental impact**.

## 🛠️ How We Built It  

### 🔧 Frontend  
- **HTML** + **CSS** for responsive layout and dark theme with green accents  
- **JavaScript** for:
  - Game mechanics (click detection, timer, score, item spawning)  
  - Mode switching and UI feedback  

### 🧠 AI Integration  
- Custom-trained image recognition model  
- Mobile-first camera interface  
- Real-time processing with recyclability classification  

### 🗺️ Map Component  
- **Leaflet.js** with custom markers and styling  
- Two-panel layout (70% map / 30% scrollable list)  
- Dynamic event data + click-to-join logic  

### 👨‍💻 Team Collaboration  
- Divided roles: frontend design, game logic, AI, and map integration  
- Prioritized accessibility and mobile responsiveness  

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments We’re Proud Of  

- Built a **fully functional game** with real-time interactivity  
- Achieved **85%+ AI accuracy** on recyclable item detection  
- Developed a **real-world map** that promotes environmental action  
- Created a platform that’s engaging, educational, and scalable  

---

## 📚 What We Learned  

- Training and deploying **image recognition models**  
- Integrating camera APIs and building **real-time AI feedback loops**  
- Creating map-based UIs using **Leaflet.js**
